	<h2 STYLE="color:White"> Cross Country </h2>
	<p> <i>Cross country</i> has been a main aspect of my life since middle school. Being part of a runner family, it was inevitable that I would continue the tradition. Since middle school cross country was not as time consuming, I was able to also do gymnastics and swimming. But once high school running began, the commitment became serious, and I had to decide to focus on solely running. My team was dedicated and worked hard, leading to three state championships in the four years I was there. I've decided to continue running in college on the <b>UGA club team</b>, where I have the choice of how competitive to be and how much time I want to dedicate to it. Running has become a lifestyle for me, and I can't go a day without it. To see out my high school team's result, check out this link! <a href="http://www.mocorunning.com/team.php?team_id=19"> Walter Johnson Running </a> </p>

	<p> I've always loved sports, and throughout my life I have tried out many different ones before settling on running. These are the sports I have tried throughout the years: </p>

	<h2 STYLE="color:White"> Choir </h2>
	<p> My interest in <i>singing</i> and <i>music</i> began at a very young age, but didn't become a passion until the 6th grade. My chorus teacher had so much energy and compassion, making me want to sing more and more. I was selected for the acapella group in 7th grade, and we had the opportunity to sing the national anthem at a National's baseball game. In high school I was chosen to be a part of the Madrigal Chamber Choir group, where we performed and competed in music festivals with very tough music. As of now, I have not found a way to continue my singing in college, but I hope to find a way I can pick it up again! </p>
	<h2 STYLE="color:White"> Lifeguarding </h2>
	<p> <i>Lifeguarding</i> has been that job that is more like a fun activity for me. I competed for a summer swim club starting in 6th grade, and grew up with the kids and families involved with the team. When I stopped swimming to focus on running, I still wanted to be a part of the pool community, so I began lifeguarding in high school. Everyday I was able to work with close friends and enjoy the pool in the summer heat. Although it could be boring and tiring at points, lifeguarding was a great student job to make money, while doing something I enjoyed with friends. It also worked around my schedule, so I could choose the amount of hours I wanted to work. This past summer I decided to work much more than before, and typically spent 5 days a week at the pool. </p>
	<h4> Although lifeguarding is my most current job, I have also had a few other jobs:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> Swim Lesson Instructor</li>
	<li> Camp Counselor </li>
	<li> Babysitter </li>
	<li> Dog Walker </li>
	<li> Cat Sitter </li>
	</ul>
